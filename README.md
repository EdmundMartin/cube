# Cube

Code which accompanies Manning's [Build an Orchestrator in Go From Scratch](https://www.manning.com/books/build-an-orchestrator-in-go-from-scratch).
Doesn't include the code from the book which will only work on Linux machines, as I develop on a Mac
so it's inclusion would have been pointless here.
